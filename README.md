## Description 
El Validation is a javascript module which is built in order to deal with single and multi validation for all types of forms and inputs. El validation module uses "validation with jquery" as a dependency. Validation-with-jquery is a javascript framework which is based on jQuery. You can check the documentation from [here](https://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/)

For more styling and good looking I had used materialize(http://materializecss.com/) framework.
